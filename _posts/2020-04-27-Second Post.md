# Cake

## Eating it

I like to have my cake and eat it, especially if someone else has baked it for me.

## Determination of optimal cake ingredients

The very important equation $\sum_n (x) = cake$ has often been misunderstood by mathematicians and bakers alike.  Only when placing the equation on a separate paragraph like so:

$$
\sum_n (x) = cake
$$

can one begin to imagine the depth of the cake tin.
